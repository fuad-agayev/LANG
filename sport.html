        There was hope when the Los Angeles Lakers hired a new coach — former sharpshooter J.J.
        Redick — in the offseason that he would be able to wring the most value out of a mismatched roster that made it through only five games of the playoffs last season.
        After a quiet summer in terms of trades and signings, the Lakers were seemingly banking on Redick to lift up a team that hasn’t won a conference finals game since 2020, 
        the last time it felt as though Los Angeles was a serious title threat
        Instead, after a 134-93 shellacking at the hands of the Miami Heat on Wednesday,
        the Lakers look through roughly a quarter of the NBA season as far away from a championship as they did under the previous regime.
        And one of their problems is especially shocking.
